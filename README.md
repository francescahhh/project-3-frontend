## What to TrEAT?

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

**Project Pitch:**
Our web application, What to TrEAT?, aims to solve the age-old question “Where do you want to eat?” Our application displays a piñata on the page. When the piñata is clicked, four candies will appear on the page, each containing a restaurant suggestion pulled from the database built out in Active Record. With each restaurant suggestion, the name and the category of the restaurant (American, Asian fusion, Mexican inspired, etc.) will be displayed but the user name of who submitted that choice will be hidden. From the four randomized restaurants provided, the application will allow you to eliminate the restaurants you don’t want. The application will also allow you to click the piñata again to get a new selection of four randomized restaurant choices. This application will also include an input field where the user can input their own restaurant choice and add it to the database.

**User Stories:**
As a user, I should be able to…

  -Click on the piñata and have 4 random restaurants generated to choose from.
  
  -Remove the unwanted choices from the random selection.
  
  -Generate a new list of choices.
  
  -Add a new restaurant to the list.
  
  -Remove a restaurant from the list.
  
  -View a list of every restaurant.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
